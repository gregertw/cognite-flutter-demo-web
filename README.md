# cognite-flutter.demo: Flutter demo app for Cognite Data Fusion (CDF)

**Maintainer**: Greger Wedel, https://gregertw.github.io/cognite-flutter-demo/

## Demo App

This is a repository to use Github Pages to host the app found at https://gregertw.github.io/cognite-flutter-demo-web/.
## Web version

This app can run on any Flutter supported platform. The [web version is hosted on Github](https://gregertw.github.io/cognite-flutter-demo-web/).


The purpose of this app is to demonstrate how to use Flutter to access the Cognite Data Fusion platform (CDF). You 
can get access a public data set hosted on CDF on [Open Industrial Data](https://openindustrialdata.com/get-started/). Get an access key, use `publicdata` as project and find a timeseries to explore, e.g. `pi:160623`is an example. 
**NOTE!!!** You will NOT find data the last 7 days, so you need to specify > 7 days in the configuration.
